## Overview

Lingan is a Python library designed for computational exploration of diachronic corpora and temporal linguistic patterns. It provides functions and tools to analyze text data organized by time periods, offering modular components for vocabulary statistics, embeddings, and more.

## Installation

The repository can only be installed by cloning for now. We are planning to upload the codebase to the pypi to support pip installation.

### Operation


## Example Usage

Explore `examples/temporal_freq.py` and Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step tutorials.
